# Learning Data Science with AI
## 🚧 Ongoing Project — Actively Updated
This repository is a continuous, evolving learning project. I update it regularly as I progress through new concepts and complete exercises. Expect frequent additions, improvements, and restructuring as my skills grow and the project matures.

## 🎓 Project Overview
This repository documents my journey learning data science and machine learning fundamentals through a structured, hands-on approach. Using **Claude AI** as an interactive learning tool, I'm working through progressive exercises that build toward a comprehensive final project: **Customer Segmentation and Sales Prediction Analysis**
## 🤖 Learning Methodology
Why AI-Assisted Learning?  
Rather than passively following tutorials, I'm using Claude AI as:

* An interactive instructor that breaks down complex topics into digestible exercises
* A code reviewer that checks my solutions and provides feedback
* A resource that explains concepts when I get stuck
* A guide that ensures I understand fundamentals before moving forward

My Approach

* Exercise-First Learning: Each concept is introduced through practical exercises with TODO sections I must complete
* Incremental Complexity: Start with basics, gradually build to advanced topics
* Hands-On Practice: Every skill is practiced multiple times before integration
* Active Problem Solving: I write the code myself - no copy-paste learning
* Verification & Feedback: Solutions are reviewed to ensure understanding

## 📚 Topics Covered
## Module 1: NumPy Fundamentals
Skills Covered:

* Array creation and manipulation
* Statistical operations (mean, std, sum)
* Array indexing and slicing
* Broadcasting and vectorization
* Data standardization (z-score normalization)

Exercises:

* Exercise 1.1: Basic NumPy operations on customer data
* Exercise 1.2: Data standardization implementation

Key Takeaway: NumPy is the foundation for numerical computing in Python and essential for understanding how data flows through ML models.

## Module 2: Pandas for Data Manipulation
Skills Covered:

* DataFrame creation and manipulation
* Data selection and filtering (boolean indexing)
* GroupBy operations for aggregation
* Handling missing data
* Merging and joining DataFrames
* Feature engineering

Exercises:

* Exercise 2.1: Create customer DataFrame with multiple features
* Exercise 2.2: Merge customer and transaction data
* Exercise 2.3: Advanced aggregations and transformations

Key Takeaway: Pandas is the workhorse of data analysis - master groupby and merge operations for real-world data tasks.

## Module 3: SQL Database Integration
Skills Covered:

* SQLite database creation and management
* Writing SELECT queries with WHERE clauses
* JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
* Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
* GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses
* Integrating SQL with Pandas workflows

Exercises:

* Exercise 3.1: Create database and perform basic queries
* Exercise 3.2: Complex JOIN queries for customer analytics
* Exercise 3.3: SQL aggregations and subqueries

Key Takeaway: SQL is essential for data analysis. Even with Pandas, SQL knowledge makes you more versatile and valuable.

## Module 4: Data Visualization
Skills Covered:

* Matplotlib basics (line plots, scatter plots, bar charts)
* Seaborn for statistical visualizations
* Creating subplots and figure layouts
* Customizing plots (colors, labels, legends)
* Choosing appropriate visualization types

Exercises:

* Exercise 4.1: Create multi-panel customer analysis dashboard
* Exercise 4.2: Statistical visualizations with Seaborn
* Exercise 4.3: Interactive plot customization

Key Takeaway: Good visualizations communicate insights effectively. Learn to choose the right chart for your data story.

## Module 5: Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
Skills Covered:

* Data preprocessing with StandardScaler
* K-Means clustering algorithm
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Model evaluation metrics
* Interpreting clustering results
* Dimensionality reduction techniques

Exercises:

* Exercise 5.1: Customer segmentation with K-Means
* Exercise 5.2: PCA for visualization of high-dimensional data
* Exercise 5.3: Elbow method for optimal cluster selection

Key Takeaway: Unsupervised learning reveals hidden patterns in data. Clustering and PCA are fundamental tools for exploratory analysis.

## Module 6: Neural Networks with PyTorch
Skills Covered:

* PyTorch tensor operations
* Building custom neural network architectures
* Defining loss functions and optimizers
* Implementing training loops
* Forward and backward propagation
* Model evaluation and predictions
* Regularization techniques (dropout)

Exercises:

* Exercise 6.1: Simple regression neural network
* Exercise 6.2: Multi-layer architecture for prediction
* Exercise 6.3: Training loop optimization and evaluation

Key Takeaway: Deep learning with PyTorch provides powerful tools for complex predictions. Understanding the training loop is fundamental.

## Module 7: Final Integration Project
Comprehensive Application:
